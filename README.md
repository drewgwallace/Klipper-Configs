# About
This is Klipper templates and config files assembled for Prusa MK3S Bear, Prusa MK3S Bear 310mm z-height, and Fysetc Voron V2.4 R2.
All running in Klipper on Mainsail.

NOTE: This is a working config! The printer.cfg templates contain printer-specific values that will need adapted to your needs.

This repository is left public for other's reference. I hope it may help some.
